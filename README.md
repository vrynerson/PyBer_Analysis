# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Challenge
## Overview of the Analysis: 
In the inital PyBer ride-share analysis, the type of cities were divided into categories: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers for each type of city were compared by using pie charts. In the new analysis, the total fare by city type in January to end of April of 2019 was made into a multiple-line chart to showcase the differences in price over the four months indicated. This data analysis could be used in decisions regarding fares, hiring, and rate promotions.

## Results: 

Below is a DataFrame from the analysis. In both Total Rides and Total Drivers columns, the amount of rides and drivers rise as the city population increases. In the Total Fares column, the amount increases almost fivefold from Rural to Suburban and almost doubles from Suburban to Urban. In both Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver columns, the monetary values decrease as the city population increases.

Below is a multiple-line graph displaying the trends of the fares in $USD by the type of city. Rural cities stay at or below $500 in the four month span shown. Suburban cities have a notable peak towards the end of February, reading about $1,400 in fares. Urban cities stay the highest amount among all the city types with a couple peaks around $2,470 in the last week of February and the first week of March. The lowest fare data for Urban cities is $1,661 in the beginning of January.

## Summary: 
To address concerns for disparities between city types the following are recommended:
  * Analyzing data from the full year would be beneficial for a bigger sample size. This would result in stronger trends. Summer months may bring more revenue for trips to visiting quaint, rural, small towns from Urban and Suburban cities. Promotions and deals could be advertised to stimulate interest.  
  * Increasing the amount of drivers during holidays and weekends can be beneficial for riders who are celebrating or out and about. These clients usually are not looking to drive themselves to and from locations. Special promotions or coupons can be offered to Suburban and Rural riders to encourage accessibility.
  * The results show that Urban cities are are most served and generate the most revenue, but becuase of the saturation of drivers and rides, the per ride fare is cheaper. Rural cities have less drivers, but even less rides. This leads to the expensive fares for riders. Instead of hiring more Suburban and Rural drivers with no promise of demand in the underserved areas, incentives could be given to the already established Urban drivers for taking the rides. Incentives could be ones to directly affect the vehicle and bring business to Rural economies. A contract could be worked out with local auto shops, car washing stations, or gas stations. More research and surveys can be done to dive deeper into this idea.
