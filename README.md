# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
In the inital PyBer ride share analysis, the type of city, Urban, Suburban, and Rural, were put into categories. The percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers for each type of city were compared by using pie charts. In the new analysis, the total fare by city type in January to end of April of 2019 was made into a line graph to showcase the differences in price over the four months indicated.

## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Below is a DataFrame from the analysis. In both Total Rides and Total Drivers columns, the amount of rides and drivers rise as the city population increases. In the Total Fares column, the amount increases almost fivefold from Rural to Suburban and almost doubles from Suburban to Urban. In both Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver columns, the monetary values decrease as the city population increases.
